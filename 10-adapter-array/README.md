I started out wondering whether I was misreading the question, because it seemed like the random order of the adapters was pointless and that you'd just evaluate them in ascending order. That seemed to prove true, so I just did a `.sort()` on the list before processing it.

Also, I'm surprised how amused I am by "jolts" and "joltage" ðŸ˜†
