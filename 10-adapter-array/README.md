# Notes

## Part One

I started out wondering whether I was misreading the question, because it seemed like the random order of the adapters was pointless and that you'd just evaluate them in ascending order. That seemed to prove true, so I just did a `.sort()` on the list before processing it.

Also, I'm surprised how amused I am by "jolts" and "joltage" ðŸ˜†

## Part Two

This feels like a math problem for math I don't know. I thought about trying to calculate combinations from `adapters[i]` to `adapters[j]` and then multiplying all of those sub-groups together, or using recursion with memoization, but nothing felt right. After seeing some friends agree that this was very hard if you didn't know the right math, I caved and looked at solutions. I'm amazed at how simple the solution I copied is, but I still feel like I only half understand it. I decided I'd rather copy this and keep pushing myself to do future puzzles than to sweat this one and stall out. Making myself a note in the top-level README to come back and review this one.
