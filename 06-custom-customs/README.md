# Notes

## Part One

Using python sets to remove duplicates from group answers made part 1 feel very easy. Wondering how part 2 will make this feel like a trap ðŸ˜†

## Part Two

I've caught myself trying to be thoughtful during part one of these puzzles, trying to make my code flexible and re-usable so it will be adaptable for part two. I think I'm learning that will always be a tough balance; today's solution for part one felt just right given the problem, but almost none of it felt adaptable for part two.

I'm also pushing myself to overcome the desire to do everything myself. For part two, I initially started thinking of different ways to count answers for the groups, but ultimately decided it makes more sense to import Counter and let it do the thing it's really good at instead of reinventing the wheel.
