# Notes

## Part One

I recognized pretty quickly that this problem was meant to be solved with recursion. I have a basic understanding of recursion, but wouldn't say I'm confident with it. It was hard for me to get my head around how I would write the recursive function, but once I stopped fretting and started writing, it came to me soon enough.

## Part Two

I struggled with this one. I walked away and came back to this a few times. In the end, I was overcomplicating the conditions and tests and counts within the recursive function. I have a hand-wavy level of familiarity with recursion, and this forced me to get a clearer understanding of the details so I could mentally trace the flow of the program.
