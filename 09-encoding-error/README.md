# Notes

## Part One

I was about to start by digesting the input into a list as I have been with other puzzles, then iterating over the list to convert the strings to integers, but that felt clumsy. Did a quick search and learned to use the map function to do that processing when the file is read.

## Part Two

That wasn't bad either! I liked that I had tools in the back of my mind like pushing and popping from lists, summing lists, and min/max functions. Using those feels like a proper solution vs a bunch of clumsy looping.

Still unsure how experienced devs would judge this code, especially my use of var names like `i` and `j` when iterating.
